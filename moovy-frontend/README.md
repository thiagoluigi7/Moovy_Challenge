## Problems 

1. The web app (frontend) is not in typescript yet. <br> <br>

2. When a user log in, in the frontend their movies are not loaded from the database yet. <br> <br>

3. The localStorage is not respecting the user. Showing the same movies no matter what user logs in. This problem is related to the problem #2. <br> <br>
